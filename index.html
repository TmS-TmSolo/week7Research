    What are the differences between var, let, and const? 

https://javascripttoday.com/blog/var-vs-let-vs-const/ 

The main differential between the 3 are the type of scopes they have. Var is scoped outside of the block or globally as let and const are scoped inside of the block or block scoped.  The difference in scope can lead to problems and/or limitations on both ends. Var being function scoped means it can be used in the entirety of the function scope, so we must be careful how we are using it. Let was created to somewhat replace Var as it is only accessible in the block it is in, allowing it to be changed later without disruption or error. Let and Const are similar in scope but differing in alteration; let can be changed as const stays constant throughout. Let was brought in to replace var, so of course it should be used more frequently and const has it’s very reason to be used with consistency. 

 

What are the differences between callbacks and promises?

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises 

 

 Promises are objects representing the answer of two or more events returning true or false, correct or wrong. Callbacks are a function that passes an argument into another function to return an action, somewhat answering for the response of the function’s happenings. The way the two are chained and the way the two are read are two main differences. Promises are forward in readability, purely representing the completion or failure of an asynchronous event. Callbacks are used inside of a function to callback to get a result upon the completion and are attached to promises. Promises are telling the computer that this will happen as callbacks are saying when this happens do this covering their basis. I do not quite understand the chaining of the promises together but it seems to be a very powerful tool and will be used proficiently. 

 

What are some new features introduced in ES6? 

https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp 

	The main new features in 2017 with ES6 were let, const, and arrow functions. Pretty much everything we have learned the last two weeks in the program are new to ES6, promises, classes, template literals, default parameters. Let and const are two new ways to declare variables adding to/replacing var. Arrow functions brought in more concise ways to define functions in one-line, cleaning up code. Template literals allow multi-line strings, making it easier to console.log without adding every space, speaks to the strings alot better. Default parameters allows defining values to set parameters.
